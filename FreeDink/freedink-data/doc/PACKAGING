Packaging
=========

Installation prefix
-------------------

The Makefile should install the files in the right location.  It
supports DESTDIR.


dir.ff
------

Those are 'fast-files', a very basic non-compressed archive with an
offsets index and then the files contents.

Do not attempt to extract the data - cf. dirff.txt for explanations.


Story/*.c
---------

The .c files are 'DinkC' scripts and are only vaguely related to the C
programming language.  They can be compressed to '.d' files (using
byte-pair-encoding) but this was only historicaly used as cheap
obfuscation, and makes patches uneasy , so just leave them as '.c'.


Sounds
------

The original game contained sounds that were not owned by RTsoft and
hence could not be released under a free license.  We're looking for
free replacements!  See README.txt and README-REPLACEMENTS.txt.
