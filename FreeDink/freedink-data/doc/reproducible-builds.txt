FreeDink-data tries to make reproducible builds.


Source tarball

- See Makefile.

- Reproducibility not really useful here (only generated files need to
  be reproducible) but still a good exercise.

- The reproducible build instructions cannot be fixed / updated for a
  new environment since they are part of the release tarball.

- However the tarball doesn't leak any metadata about the developer.


Zip -nosrc release

- See autobuild/freedink-data-woe.sh

- This is generated from the source tarball hence needs to be
  reproducible.
