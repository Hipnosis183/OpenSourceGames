- Warn about case-sensitive duplicates (e.g. MAP.DAT and map.dat) when
  creating a .dmod

- Offer to define SDL_VIDEODRIVER and SDL_AUDIODRIVER. This is
  interesting under woe to use 'directx' instead of the default
  'windib' video driver, and under GNU/Linux to try different audio
  drivers when one isn't working well.
