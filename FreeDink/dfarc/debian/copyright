DFArc was previously released under different yet GPL-compatible
licenses (cf. COPYING.DFArc and COPYING.DFArc-2.0) that request some
notices to be included with modified versions, including in binary
form.  We reproduce these notices below:

      * The files produced by DFArc are not subject to this license but instead any licensing terms provided inside said files.
