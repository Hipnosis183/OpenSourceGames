About GNU
---------

FreeDink is part of the GNU project, whose aim is to create "GNU", a
completely free (as in freedom) operating system. Its most famous
variant these days is GNU/Linux. A engine to play the Dink Smallwood
game and D-Mods is definitely a must for the GNU OS ;) Check
http://www.gnu.org/ for more information.
