  the editor even when the game is running.

- Improve extract & package performance.

- Fix infrequent off-by-1-pixel bug in logo animation.

- New Serbian, Catalan, Turkish, Esperanto, Brazilian Portuguese and
  Hungarian translations, as well as translations updates.

* v3.8.1

** User-visible changes:

- Search for dink* executables case-INsensitively

- New Dutch translation

- Updated Polish translations.

* v3.8

** User-visible changes:

- Logo animation when selecting a D-Mod.

- Language selection: set DFArc's language in the Options (so you
  don't have to modify your system language to test a translation).

- Language selection: when translations are available for a D-Mod,
  allow the user to choose one in a listbox.

- Updated Danish, Finnish, Italian and Polish translations.

- Developper buttons are shown by default - we can't let users miss
  that they can makes their own games!

- If Dink crashes, don't (mistakenly) report that it was not found,
  but (correctly) report that it failed.

- Enable editor warning again, it previously stopped working because
  of a bug.

** Developer notes:

- Drop compatibility with wxWidgets 2.6, require wxWidgets 2.8.

* v3.6

- New translations: Danish (thanks Joe Hansen), German (thanks Roland
  Illig), Spanish (thanks Fernando Carmona Varo), Vietnamese (thanks
  Clytie Siddall), improved Polish (thanks MichaÅ‚ Trzebiatowski)

* v3.4

- Use only 2 numbers in versions (3.x)

- Add a man page link for 'freedink-dfarc'

* v3.2.4

- Add 'freedink-dfarc' symlink so that command-line users have more
  chances to notice dfarc

- Under ms woe, to find where Dink is installed, look in the directory
  where dfarc.exe is placed rather than in the registry or
  dinksmallwood.ini.  The Dink directory can still be explicitely
  specified in the options.

* v3.2.3

- Internationalization: new German translation and update to the
  Finnish translation

* v3.2.2

- Internationalization: translated in Macedonian and Italian

- Fix bug in Debian package that prevented the DFArc icons from
  showing up in the Applications menu

* v3.2.1

- Internationalization: translated in Finnish

* v3.2

** User-visible changes:

- Rename distro packages from dfarc to freedink-dfarc, for clarity,
  and because this version supports FreeDink-specific features.

** Developer notes:

- Supports /usr/share/games and /usr/local/share/games in addition to
  /usr/share and /usr/local/share by default.

- Add source for wxglade UI files in release tarballs.

* v3.0

** User-visible changes:

- Cross-platform: runs on Unix-style platforms (GNU/Linux, *BSD...).

- Internationalization: translated in English, French and Polish.

- FreeDesktop integration (menu entry, file association...).

- Package creation:

  - Create packages in a single step (tar+bz2 at once) instead of two.

  - Remove savegames, thumbs.db and backup files (*~).

  - Store real file modification time (not the .dmod creation time) in
    .dmod files.

  - Display compression ratio when the .dmod is created.

- Package installation:

  - More accurate progress bar

  - After installation, open DFArc and select the new D-Mod

- Options:

  - Go to the specified Dink override directory when clicking on
    "Browse" in the Options window (instead of a default location).

  - Removed options "Play introduction movie" option anymore (only
    useful for >10 years old CD version) and "List all directories"
    (replaced with better DMod auto-detection)

  - Added "Preferred file browser" option

- D-Mods can be stored in a separate directory, useful when the main
  dink directory is not writable (e.g. owned by the administrator
  while running as non-admin user)

- GUI:

  - Options, Package and Install windows can be resized.

  - The description textbox can be resized with a window splitter.

  - When there's no D-Mod logo, display the name of the D-Mod instead
    of whole black.

  - Select "dink" on first run. Display "< Pick a D-Mod" if none is
    selected.

  - The main window is slightly bigger, due a new, cross-platform
    method to compute the preferred window size.


** Developer notes:

- File permissions set to 644 instead of 666 in generated .tar files.

- File names are now encoded to UTF-8 in .tar files instead of using
  non-consistent wxString.c_str(). Apparently v1.08's DFArc2 was built
  using an ASCII build of wxWidgets which converted filenames to ASCII
  + current 8bit locale (e.g. latin1 for a French install)... and
  crashed when conversion was not possible (e.g. Arabic
  characters). For backward compatibility, during extracting, DFArc2
  will still try to interpret filenames as latin-1 if not valid UTF-8.

- File type in tar header is now '0'(48) instead of '\0'(0) - that's
  what modern Tar implementations do.

- DFArcFrame and Options windows are converted to wxGlade.

- Autoconfiscation: the build system uses Autoconf and Automake.

- Can be cross-compiled to Woe using mingw32, in shared and static (no
  .dll needed) modes.

- Compiles with Unicode and non-Unicode wxWidgets builds.

- Can use UPX to compress executable.

- Add --version and --help (GNU standards and 'make distcheck'
  compliance).

- Use octal mode to interpret permissions (755 -> 0755)

- BZip2 "work factor" reset to default (normally 30) instead of an
  arbitrary value of "90" (on a ]0, 250] range).

- Debian packages (.deb) available.

- Don't send '?src=DFArc2' when the user clicks on a URL. Privacy
  first, especially since the user isn't told about it.
