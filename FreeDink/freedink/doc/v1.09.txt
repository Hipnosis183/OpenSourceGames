  http://www.dinknetwork.com/file/malachi_the_jerk/version/1_3_semicolon_special/

    - lack of semicolons at the end of goto statments causes them not to work

    - won't display choice menu text while faded down.

    - doesn't erase corpses and blood when draw_background is used

    - uses different keycodes for certain letters

    - No palette mode (and no load_palette())
