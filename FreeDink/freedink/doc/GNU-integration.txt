Since FreeDink is part of the GNU project, we need to stick to its
principles and integrate into the rest of the operating system.

That means, in a nutshell:

- Follow the following documents:
  * Information for maintainers of GNU software
    http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/
  * GNU coding standards 
    http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/

- Prefer GNU technologies:
  * The autotools build system (autoconf, automake, libtool)
  * The Gtk+ 2 GUI library
  * The Guile extension language (Scheme-like, although translators
    from other languages to Scheme exists)
  * No need to use GNU Leg (Libraries and Engines for Games), since we
    already have an engine and backward compatibility constraints
  * gettext for internationalization (i18n)
  * Possibly use the DejaGNU testing framework
  * The Texinfo documentation system

- Project public places:
  * http://www.gnu.org/software/freedink/ : homepage.
  * http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freedink : project page at
    Savannah, the GNU project's SourceForge clone, where I (Beuc) am
    incidentally admin.
