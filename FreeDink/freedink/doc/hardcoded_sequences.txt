Here are the sequence numbers that are directly used by the game.  The
original game would crash if they were not present.  They are not
configurable.

seq 165 - process_show_bmp():

  little star in the map stating where the player currently is


seq 423 frame 7, seq 423 frame 8 - draw_wait():

  2-images "Please Wait" flashing text before you enter a screen
  containing lots of new sprites



Same for sound:

* 19: in a choice, when moving through the choices, with the mouse or
  the keyboard
