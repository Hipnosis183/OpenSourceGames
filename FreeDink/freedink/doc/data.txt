Data from the original game commonly needed by D-Mods
=====================================================

Now that we have a working portable game engine, it would make sense
to distribute it along with all data necessary to run D-Mods.

Currently the most straightforward solution is to run the official
installer through Wine and grab the data::

  wget http://files.dinknetwork.com/dinksmallwood108.exe
  wine dinksmallwood108.exe
  mv ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Dink\ Smallwood \
    /usr/local/share/dink/

It's also possible to extract the data using the '7z' extraction tool
from http://files.dinknetwork.com/dinksmallwood108.exe (see
contrib/dextract for an automated extraction script - though some
files are skipped for unknown reason by 7-Zip)


Last, there's a repackaging of v1.06 made by Dan Walma and approved by
Seth A. Robinson::

  wget http://files.dinknetwork.com/dinksmallwood106.zip
  mkdir -p /usr/local/share
  unzip -d /usr/local/share -L dinksmallwood106.zip


However, it's not free (as in freedom), thus it cannot be included in
GNU/Linux distributions. Seth is open to releasing most data files
under a zlib-like license, except for sound which he doesn't own, and
data which was never released such as the 3D models.

The graphics pack was released under a pretty lax license (free for
D-Mods and freeware games). In the worst case we could extend this to
a subset of the Dink Smallwood original story. This subset would not
cover the original Dink Smallwood story, but would cover files
commonly required by D-Mods.

This way, FreeDink would ship with a free base data pack that could be
included in distros and could run any D-Mod out of the box.

We could also imagine creating a very small pack containing the
missing non-free story files, so that people could easily play the
original game after installing FreeDink.


Graphics differences
--------------------

(between dinkgraphics.zip and an extraction of all dir.ff files)

dinkgraphics.zip is free for everybody to use in "FREEWARE"
games. This is a good candidate for the base data pack. However, it is
not complete because it has a few differences with the original Dink
graphics.


Method for the comparison:

- extraction of dir.ff files using utils/ffrextract.c

- all filenames to lowercase using lc_dmod.sh (from old SDL port)

- diff -r dinkgraphics/ 106/dink/graphics/


Results:

- graphics/effects/magic: the original game's end boss animation
  (poseXX.bmp and sethXwXX.bmp) are not present in dinkgraphics. These
  graphics are used in some D-Mods such as End of Time v2.

- item-w22.bmp and item-w23.bmp (herb boots graphics) are missing in
  dinkgraphics.

- graphics/items/food/food-31.bmp (King Daniel!) is missing in
  dinkgraphics.

- lands/trees/treefire/tree-f17.bmp is somewhat corrupted in
  dinkgraphics (about 4 rows of pixels are postponed 2 pixels to the
  right, which looks ugly). Same for struct/castle/castl-03.bmp,
  struct/castle/castl-08.bmp, struct/castle/castl-09.bmp,
  struct/home/home-06.bmp, struct/home/home-09.bmp

- inter/text-box/main-01.bmp is different (there's an additional white
  area in dinkgraphics, which was probably removed later on to make
  the text easier to read)


Other differences that do not matter:

- dink/morph: dinkgraphics is not properly numbered so it can't be
  used directly as a sequence), but all the animation frames are the
  same. dinkgraphics also has an extra frame (dinkm17.bmp)! Mystery
  Island did copy this animation in their graphics/ directory rather
  reuse it from the original graphics anyway.

- there's a top-level dir.ff that contains a copy of
  inter\text-box\main-


Note: there was no change to graphics/ in v1.07 and v1.08, so this
comparison is valid for those versions too.


Tiles
-----

All tiles from the original games were reused in various D-Mods. It
would be good to be able to redistribute them all.

Tiles also depend on HARD.DAT for the default tile hardness, so this
file is also necessary.


Scripts
-------

At first glance, here is the list of all DinkC files that may be used
in D-Mods (as opposed to: "related to the original Dink Smallwood
story itself").

Those are good candidates for the base data pack.

Sounds
------

All sounds and music from the original games (except for the
commercial CD audio tracks) were reused in various D-Mods.

In addition, freedinkedit.exe (from version 1.06) contains 2 embedded
sounds that were extracted and shipped with FreeDink - they need legal
clarification.


Unfortunately, most of the sounds effects are not redistributable.
From the game's credits.txt:

  Most were licensed from Hollywood Edge (tm). (www.hollywoodedge.com)
  Many were created by us as well, most using a Korg T3 & X3 keyboard.
  (level up wave, choir noise when you pickup a strength potion, etc)
  Sound Forge was also used.

We need to replace the hollywood version, which mostly include all war
and atmosphere sounds (fighting, fire, beasts, etc.).


Some MIDIs were made by Seth. Other midis have unclear legal status
and should not be redistributed - or we need to find their original
source again.

  Special thanks to Mitch Brink for doing additional midi music for the
  demo.  His webpage is at http://www.geocities.com/~mitchb2/
  
  The rest are favorite classical pieces of mine taken from the
  public domain.
  
Two MIDIs are MIDI versions of original CD sound tracks, available at
http://www.dinknetwork.com/file/dink_smallwood_cd_audio/ (announcement
at http://www.dinknetwork.com/forum.cgi?MID=67456):

2.mid -> #2
1003.mid -> #3

(at least that's the two I recognised)

Track #6 in that pack sounds like a classical piece rather than
'Bravery theme'.


Some Mitch Brink's MIDIs are still available at
http://www.mbsoundworks.com/demos.html#GM

Unfortunately this is only those from Mystery Island:
- Cave (island cave)
- Deserted Town (island town)
- Main Theme (splash screen)
- Mandibles (sea event, e.g. sharks)
- Map Screen (new game intro)
- Pirate Theme (on ship)
- Rescued (end)
- Robot Lab (end boss)
- Tavern (?)


The name "Noke Kuge" gives some results in search engines, but not
many.


Duplicates:
- 4.mid, Battle.mid [battle with soldiers]
- 6.mid, 18.mid [end boss theme]
- 10.mid, 107.mid, Caveexpl.mid [cave]
