1.07 8bit: it's designed to fade down during 1000ms; if the computer
is too slow, the fade will be incomplete (semi-dark)


1.08 8bit: it's designed to take 500ms

1.08 true-color: it's designed to take 400ms (coded differently)
  However, one of the values (i.e. fps_final) used to determine the
  time may be "adjusted" depending on your computer speed, so this may
  vary. Typically if you have a very fast computer (able to refresh
  the dink screen in < 12ms) the fade will go faster because of a
  miscomputation. Similarly if the computer is too slow and refreshes
  less than 15 FPS (more than 70ms), the fade will take longer.

1.08 true-color FreeDink: takes 400ms


The fade_up() time is different:

1.07 8bit: depends on whether the game could complete a complete
  fade_down(), or only a partial one (fade_up will then be
  quicker). It then depends on computer speed (the faster computer,
  the quicker fade)

1.08 8bit: similarly depends on computer speed (except that
  fade_down() was always complete)

1.08 true-color: same as fade_down() 32bit
