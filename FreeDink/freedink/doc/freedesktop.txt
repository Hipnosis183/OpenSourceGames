freedesktop.org promotes a standard way to deal with graphical
environments such as Gnome, KDE or Enlightenment.

We use their specifications to provide menu entries (see
share/applications) along with associated icons (share/pixmaps).

There are tools to check the .desktop files syntax and install
them. However, I tried the Debian Lenny 'desktop-file-utils' package,
and it complains about a missing "Encoding" field while it is marked
as deprecated in the specification... We'll do without for now.
