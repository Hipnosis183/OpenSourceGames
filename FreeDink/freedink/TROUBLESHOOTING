Troubleshooting
===============

Graphics
--------

Q: Under GNU/Linux on 16:9 screens, the image is streched horizontally

A: You can configure your screen scaling mode; with xrandr in a console:

     xrandr  # check your screenname, e.g. LVDS-1
     xrandr --output LVDS-1 --set "scaling mode" "Full aspect"


Sound
-----

Q: I want FreeDink to use my MIDI hardware or fluidsynth setup, but it
   uses TiMidity or default Fluidsynth instead.

A: SDL_mixer (the MIDI component that FreeDink uses) can use both
   hardware and software sequencer. If '/etc/timidity/timidity.cfg' is
   present, it will use that first. You can remove that file if you
   want to use '/dev/sequencer' directly :)

   Under Debian, you can disable fluidsynth by using a wrong soundfont
   path:
     SDL_FORCE_SOUNDFONTS=1 freedink

   (you may also try fiddling with SDL_SOUNDFONTS=<paths>)

   You can also see above that there are some issues if
   '/dev/sequencer' is present but not functionnal, so it's best we
   use TiMidity by default for common Dinkers, and just let you remove
   '/etc/timidity/timidity.cfg' if you know better ;)


Q: FreeDink is eating all the memory

A: Try running FreeDink with fluidsynth *disabled* (see previous entry):

     SDL_FORCE_SOUNDFONTS=1 SDL_SOUNDFONTS= freedink

   Cf. https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=748090


Q: Under GNU/Linux, FreeDink freezes when trying to play a sound or
   music.

A: SDL_mixer (the component that provides the sound) is known to
   freeze when:
   * /dev/sequencer is present and
   * /etc/timidity/timidity.cfg isn't.
   An easy fix is to install Timidity++ (see BUILD).

   More information at
   http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=369670

   Note that the Debian version of SDL_mixer now attemps to read
   /etc/timidity/freepats.cfg as well.


Joystick
--------

Q: The mouse cursor is constanatly going up by itself.

A: If you run FreeDink in debug mode (option -d), and you see
   something like this:

   [info ]     ThinkPad HDAPS joystick emulation
   [info ]     ThinkPad HDAPS accelerometer data
   [info ] Picking the first one...
   [info ] Name: ThinkPad HDAPS joystick emulation
   [info ] Number of axes: 2
   [info ] Number of buttons: 0
   [info ] Number of balls: 0
   [info ] Number of hats: 0

   This means SDL interprets your laptop's accelerometer as a joystick
   device. This is nearly guaranteed to cause trouble, see here for
   more information:

   http://bugs.debian.org/690483

   You can also disable the joystick (option --nojoy).
