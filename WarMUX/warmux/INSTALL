Compilation/Installation under Linux
-----------------------------------

==============
* Dependencies
==============

If the following software is not presently on your system, you will need to download them
before attempting to install Warmux 0.8 on your computer...

* All dependencies in one command (Debian/Ubuntu)
-------------------------------------------------

sudo apt-get install g++ gettext \
   libxml2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev \
   libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev \
   libcurl4-dev libsdl-net1.2-dev

* SDL
-----

Warmux needs the SDL library version 1.2.

It can be downloaded of their website: http://www.libsdl.org/

* SDL mixer, SDL image, SDL ttf and SDL gfx, SDL net
----------------------------------------------------

SDL is split into small modules. Warmux needs mixer (sound), image (load
picture file), ttf (draw text), gfx (graphical things) and net (network).

You may have trouble installing SDL gfx: Warmux *needs* version 2.0.13 or
greater. Download it and compile it.

Here are their website:
 http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
 http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
 http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
 http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/
 http://www.ferzkopp.net/Software/SDL_gfx-2.0/

* libxml++
----------

Warmux uses the libxml++ library version 2.6.

Get it here: http://libxmlplusplus.sourceforge.net/

Under Debian, use the command:
	apt-get install libxml++2.6-dev


============================
* Compilation / Installation
============================

If you're using the SubVersion version of Warmux, you will have to run:

    ./autogen.sh

Under Linux, enter the Warmux directory, then simply type:

	./configure
	make

then, as root, type:

	make install

By default, the game is installed in /usr/local. But you can specify another
directory (useful if you don't have access to the root account) by modifying the
initial configure command:

	./configure --prefix=/OTHER/DIRECTORY/HERE

==============
* Uninstalling
==============

To uninstall Warmux, go to the source directory, then (as root):

	make uninstall


===============
* Other options
===============

Many options can be used with the configure command.
The most useful (for developers, at least) being:

	./configure --enable-debug

This enables you to compile Warmux with debug options, allowing you to track down bugs/other problems.

To get a list of all the other configuration options, type:

	./configure --help
