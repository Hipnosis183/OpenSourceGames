.SH NAME
Warmux \- A convivial mass murder game.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B warmux [-h|--help] [-v|--version] [-p|--play] [-i|--internet] [-s|--server] [-c|--client [ip]] [-d|--debug debug_masks]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Have the mascots of your favorite free software battle in the Warmux
arena using dynamite, grenades, baseball bat and other weapons ...
Exterminate your opponent in a funny 2D toon-style scenery.
.PP
Each player (2 minimum, on the same PC) controls the team of his
choice (tux, gnu, firefox, wilber,...) and must destroy his
adversaries using more or less casual weapons.
.PP
Although a minimum of strategy is required to be victorious, Warmux is
pre-eminently a "convivial mass murder" game where, turn by turn, each
team attempts to produce maximum damage to their opponents.
