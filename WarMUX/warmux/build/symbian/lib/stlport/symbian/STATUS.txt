************************************************************************ 

Operating systems: 
    - Symbian OS 9.1 / S60 3rd Edition 
    - Symbian OS 9.1 / UIQ 3.0 
    - Symbian OS 9.2 / S60 3rd Edition FP1 
    - Symbian OS 9.2 / UIQ 3.1 
    - Symbian OS 9.3 / S60 3rd Edition FP2 

Platform Development Kits: 
    - S60 3rd Edition 1.1 (Maintenance Release) (*) 
    - S60 3rd Edition FP1 1.0 (*) 
    - S60 3rd Edition FP2 
    - UIQ 3.0 (**) 
    - UIQ 3.1 (**) 

(*)  Either the Symbian PIPS 1.2 SDK or the Open C Plugin MR (which 
     contains the PIPS library) must be installed prior to building 
     STLport. Older versions may not work. 
(**) The Symbian PIPS 1.2 SDK must be installed prior to building 
     STLport. Older versions may not work. 

Development Environments: 
    - Command-line ABLD interface 
    - Carbide.c++ 1.3 family (note: older versions may not work) 

Build platforms/compilers: 
    - WINSCW (Emulator) 
    - GCCE 

************************************************************************ 
* KNOWN ISSUES AND LIMITATIONS 
************************************************************************ 

Limitations and disabled features: 
    - Locales are not implemented (only "C" locale is available) 

Performance considerations:
STLport adds one more abstraction layer over OS services, so it is 
expected to run slower than native Symbian OS calls. STLport is already 
optimized for some platforms/architectures, but of course it's not yet 
optimized for Symbian. Replacing generic implementations with native 
Symbian OS code will be hopefully done in next releases. Note that file 
I/O through fstream is already implemented in terms of native Symbian 
calls. 


************************************************************************ 
* TEST RESULTS 
************************************************************************ 

Unit Test status (compile-time)
    - can't compile test files that use the "signal.h" header because 
      signals are not supported by PIPS 
    - can't compile the cwchar test because WCHAR_MIN and WCHAR_MAX 
      macros defined in Symbian headers don't expand to literal numbers 

Unit Test status (run-time) 
    - all 397 tests pass 

Exception Handling Test status (compile-time) 
    - all tests compile succesfully 

Exception Handling Test status (run-time) 
    - the Deque test fails 

NOTE: runtime tests were done on following devices: Emulator, Nokia N80.
