Welcome to STLport for Symbian OS! 

If you don't know what STLport is, please go to 
http://stlport.sourceforge.net. 

This package contains a patched version of the STLport library that can 
be used on devices powered by the Symbian OS operating system, version 
9.1 and newer. The original STLport readme files are present in this 
package's root directory, please refer to them for any question 
regarding STLport itself. 

You may want to read these files too: 

STATUS.txt 
    contains information about the current status of STLport for 
    Symbian OS, including test results and supported SDKs 

INSTALL.txt 
    contains installation information. Read this if you want to 
    get the library up & running quickly 

NOTES.txt 
    contains important usage notes such as interactions between 
    STLport and the native Symbian OS environment 

CHANGES.txt 
    lists most relevant changes between the current and past 
    releases of STLport for Symbian OS 

Please note that both patched files and new files are subject to the 
same licensing conditions as the original STLport files. See ../README 
for details.
