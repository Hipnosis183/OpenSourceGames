/*
 * On EKA2 there are two kinds of toolchains - one building according to
 * abiv1 and another one building according to abiv2. These abi's are
 * linktime incompatible, but the generated binaries are runtime
 * compatible.
 *
 * Built DLLs and their import libraries have different names and can
 * thus be built using the same SDK, but static libraries, although
 * also incompatible, have the same name and thus effectively prevent
 * you from building static libraries with gcce (abiv2) and armv5 (abiv1) 
 * using the same SDK.
 *
 * The use of these macros ensure that the names are different.
 *
 * NOTE: The check should be based on whether gcce _or_ armv5_abiv2
 *       is used, but there is no(?) way for detecting whether
 *       armv5 or armv5_abiv2 is used.
