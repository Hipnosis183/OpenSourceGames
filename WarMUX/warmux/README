                     Warmux
                     ======

These are the release notes for Warmux

1/ What is Warmux ?
===================

Have the mascots of your favorite free software battle in the Warmux
arena. Using dynamite, grenades, baseball bats and other weapons...
exterminate your opponent in a 2D toon style scenery and
a funny environment.

Each player (2 minimum, on the same PC) controls the team of his
choice (tux, gnu, firefox, wilber,...) and must destroy his
adversary using more or less casual weapons.

Although a minimum of strategy is required to vanquish, Warmux is
pre-eminently a "convivial mass murder" game where, turn by turn, each
member of each team attempts to produce a maximum of damage to his
opponents.
