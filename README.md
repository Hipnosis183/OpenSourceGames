# OpenSourceGames

Collection of open-source games with personal modifications, mostly to run the software in a portable fashion, instead of relaying on installing files all over the system. Also included are fixes and proper instructions for compiling and running in newer systems, in addition of providing compiled binaries with all the data files needed, ready to use.

When a game is added, the first commit is always the original source code and assets, serving as an archive of the software as well.

Explore the different project folders on the repository to see information and instructions on how to build and use each.
