Here is a short list of the know issues in Egoboo that weren't fixed in the last release. There might be other 
issues that weren't detected hidden around the game. If you discover one, please report in in the community forums

Thanks!

KNOWN BUGS:
- If you use the Elf Armor chest in Sand Palace (which contains a tuxedo no matter what you wear when entering the module, btw), it doesn't contain your previous armor afterwards. Coming there with a Dragon Hide means that you're stuck with that stupid Tuxedo, at least for the rest of the module. 
- Need magic sparks for the sporks attacks.
- Whips attack too fast.
- Archmage Trials: After solving the mirror puzzle (with the minotaur) my character gets supersized. 
- Archmage Trials: After fighting the viking an invisible wall blocks my path. So i can't talk to the door. 
- Archmage Trials: The warlock on the cess board (actually only the left one) is attacking the player with magic missiles even when the game hasn't started. 
- In the tourist starter the spike traps are hurting the character even when he doesn't touches them. (They hurt even when standing some steps away...) 
- Imprisoned One II: After defeating the sand troll there appears no staff.
- The elemental demon can sometimes escape his prison without the locks being opened. This makes him also invincible. He's still attacking the player. 
- After killing guards or monsters with bombs a false message is displayed. (eg. "A guard killed a guard." "A sheep butchered a sheep"). Also the guards don't attack the player who set up the bomb. They attack the shepherd or the healer/alchemist. 
- Bear Trapped monsters can be moved around when they get bumped by allies.
- I know of a crash bug that I have never done anything to fix. If you play the game with sound turned off, the game will crash because the in-game music is not loaded and all the pointers are null. For some reason this is not an easy fix, but I can't remember why.
- Exploit: You can assassinate characters with bear traps. 
- Identify doesn't properly work - the scroll is always reported as wasted, and the name of the object isn't made known. Tested with the bracelet at Sand Palace and the kursed broadsword of Ice Palace. 
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)

IMPORTANT/OF MEDIUM IMPORTANCE (but still nasty) 
* Shadow Palace (often) and Ice Palace (rarely) get a warning: 
WARN: spawn_one_enchant() - failed because the required enchant owner cannot be found. 
* Petrified trolls are sometimes invulnerable. I don't know if that particular example was already dead and simply didn't poof (the doors opened), but I could damage it neither with a mallet nor with a Ring of Flames spell (that instantly kills it otherwise). 
* If you accidentally take off an amulet/a bracelet/shoes, you will often not put them on by putting them away. To activate them again, you often need to drop then and pick them up. 

COSMETIC/TRIVIAL 
* Ghouls in Shadow Palace rise either extremely fast or not at all. 
* If you step on a dead Darkshine Knight, you see a floating message of "Blocked". 
* Backstab messages in the ticker are displayed twice. 
* Stalkers in Shadow Palace are not spawned.
* Shuffling Heaps either move extremely fast or very very [...] very slow. 
* Darkshine knights tend to attack walls until you get in close range to them. 
* The "monster" from Imprisoned One is seemingly able to fly. It flings itself through the room and spams its poison bubbles on you. 
* It seems like cobol mages could create ~8 missiles if you don't kill them while they charge. Are they really much more intelligent than my Elf (Int 29, 5 missiles)? 
* Successful magical unlocking always gives out "Nothing seems to happen" plus "The door is already open." 
* Unlocking the door of the Cobol Mage room does not work; you can walk through the - still visible - door after "unlocking" it, but the middle part is not trespassable.
