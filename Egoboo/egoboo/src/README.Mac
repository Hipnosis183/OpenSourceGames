How to compile Egoboo on Mac OS X

Step 1:

You will need:
- A Mac (of course!) - It should compile on both PowerPC and Intel Macs, but it has only been tested on Intel Macs.
- Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or later
- XCode (You can find it on the Mac OS X DVD) - It has been tested with XCode 2.4 and 2.5; I don't know if it will work with an earlier version.
- The following frameworks:
  - SDL 1.2 or later (from http://libsdl.org/download-1.2.php )
  - SDL_image 1.2 or later (from http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/ )
  - SDL_mixer 1.2 or later (from http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/ )
  - SDL_ttf 2.0 or later (from http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/ )
  These should be installed into /Library/Frameworks.  If the Frameworks folder doesn't exist, create it.
- The Egoboo source distribution (2.6.9 or later)

Step 2:

Extract the Egoboo source code, and open the "osx" folder inside, then open "Egoboo.xcodeproj".

Step 3:

Make sure the active build configuration is set to "Release" (Project->Set Active Build Configuration->Release), and click "Build and Go".
