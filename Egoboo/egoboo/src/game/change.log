	big endian processors in game.c
	* added a  small function for Mac endian conversions in egobootypedef.h

2001-02-07 Morgan Aldridge <classic@sover.net>
	* Fixed DirGetNext() in mac-file.c so that it now makes sure the
	file matches the type from the search string... that fixed a bunch
	of issues with file loading.

2001-02-04 Benjamin Bishop <bishop@cs.uga.edu>
	* Looks like timing is working now. Had to uncomment the 
	  allclock line in game.c
	* attempted to add pacos elf.mod and crypt.mod levels, but
	  couldn't get them running. I'll look at this in more detail
	  later. Pal-ash also seems to be not working.

2001-02-03 Benjamin Bishop <bishop@cs.uga.edu>
	* Changed icons to reflect status of modules
	* Added boogers dungeon to the cvs
	* Mouse buttons work better. Multiple presses are getting
	  screwed up though.

2001-0203 Daniel Burrows <Daniel_Burrows@brown.edu>
	* Turn GL_CULL_FACE and GL_DEPTH_TEST off while rendering text.
	  This fixes the "mysterious vanishing text messages" bug when you
	  return to the menu after playing a game.
	* draw_wrap_string now calls BeginText() and EndText().  There may be
	  other things that get fixed, but it at least fixes the end-module text.

2001-0202 Daniel Burrows <Daniel_Burrows@brown.edu>
	* Make sure that FRAMESKIP and ONESECOND have reasonable values,
	  even on non-Windows systems.  (I was hoping this would fix the
	  framerate problems, but it doesn't seem to have; however, it's still
	  more "correct" than having completely wrong numbers)

2001-02-02 Benjamin Bishop <bishop@cs.uga.edu>
	* Did case sanatize of egoboo files, cvs had been ignoring the .obj
	  extended directories.
	* Fixed up a number of things broken by the case change.
	* "Fixed" Gnome mod to not depend on rogue for debugging purposes

2001-02-02 Daniel Burrows <Daniel_Burrows@brown.edu>
	* Fix the FPS counter.  UNIX clocks don't tick at the same rate as

	canonical POSIX define) and added a #define for broken systems.

2001-01-31 Daniel Burrows <Daniel_Burrows@brown.edu>
        * Eh, the return type of fgetc is an int, not an unsigned char.
          goto_colon in game.c was using a char, which is guaranteed to
          miss EOF (gcc was even complaining about it..)

2001-01-28 Morgan Aldridge <classic@sover.net>
	* working on converting the md2 loader to work on big endian processors:
	* added Endian.h in the Mac includes in egobootypedef.h
	* porting rip_md2_header(), rip_md2_frames(), rip_md2_frame_name(),
	rip_md2_commands() in game.c

2001-01-27 Daniel Burrows <Daniel_Burrows@brown.edu>
	* Changed many upper-case or capitalized filenames to lower-case.
	* Fixed a potential format-string problem in char.c
	* Added a new global "pending_click", which is set to TRUE when a click
	event is emitted by SDL.  See menu.c for use.  (really, this is a hack,
	but it fits better with the rest of the code than doing this the
	"right way")  It is set by read_input in input.c.
	* Changed copy_directory_to_host to copy_directory in menu.c.  This will
	have to be undone when the network code is ported, but for now it allows
	imports to work.

2001-01-27 Morgan Aldridge <classic@sover.net>
	* made gHardwareSpec extern so it isn't defined multiple times

2001-01-27 Germain Sauvé <gersauve@cgocable.ca>

	* Fixed sound bug when sound was off

2001-01-16 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>
	* Removed all references to particlescale, since we now
	  do the billboarding in world coordinates.
	* Clean-up of graphic.c. Removed most of the D3D code, except for
	  stuff that hasn't been implemented yet (ground fog and colorkeying
	  mostly.)

2001-01-17 Germain Sauvé <gersauve@cgocable.ca>
	* Remove some BeginXDMode ine graphic.c, graphicptr.c and graphicmad.c
	* Inverted s and t for reflected particules

2001-01-16 Germain Sauvé <gersauve@cgocable.ca>
	* Remove the screensize multiplication for particule size

	* Finished porting shadows 
	  (render_shadow doesn't blend correctly though)

2001-01-15 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>
	* Fixed and enabled particles. Looks great! ;-)
	  for more information on OpenGL billboarding:
		http://nate.scuzzy.net/docs/billboard.html
	* Also fixed particle reflection, started porting shadows.

2001-01-15 Benjamin Bishop <bishop@cs.uga.edu>

	  character lighting problems. 
	* Need to do: Particles
	* Need to do: Camera fix 
	* Need to do: Input (space isn't working, mouse buttons working wrong)
	* Need to do: Proper lighting
	* Need to do: Sound

2001-01-14 Morgan Aldridge <classic@sover.net>

	* Checked-in Germain's new setup.txt
	* Fudged the projection matrix to look more like D3D version.

2001-01-14 Germain Sauvé <gersauve@cgocable.ca>
	* Added option the grab and hide the mouse in setup.txt (no more #ifdef )

2001-01-14 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>
	* Potential fix for inverted colors on Mac. (in GLTexture.c, inverted
	  the RGB masks.)
	* #ifdef-ed the workarounds for mouse cursors on MacOS and Linux.

2001-01-14 Germain Sauvé <gersauve@cgocable.ca>
	* Added some cross-platform typedef. ex: typedef Sint32 LONG

2001-01-13 Matthew Fairfax <mfairfa@clemson.edu>
	* Tweaked the font code on the Mesa 3.0 drivers and got it working

2001-01-13 Morgan Aldridge <classic@sover.net>
	* Working on removing double calls to the FILENAME() macro in
	game.c and graphic.c
	* Commented out the call to hide the cursor in sdlinit() for
	debug reasons (can't use my debugger without a cursor)
	* Updated get_module_data() (in module.c) to use the FILENAME()
	macro when loading module files
	* Took out the calls to the FILENAME() macro in reset_particles()
	in particle.c

2001-01-13 Matthew Fairfax <mfairfa@clemson.edu>
	* Tweaked font drawing code (hopefully will fix the problem)
	* Disabled Alpha test but characters are still rendering transparent correctly!
	  Someone else must have done something that fixed it?

2001-01-13 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>
	* Minor optimizations of make_light_table, Begin/End 2D/3D,
	  goto_colon. (changed game.c, graphic.c, proto.h, script.c)

2001-01-12 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>
	* Minor clean-up of graphic.c
	  (should have no impact on execution.)
	* Additional clean-up of camera.c, egoboo.h, game.c and graphic.c.
	  Also optimized reading the MD2 file.

2001-1-12 Morgan Aldridge <classic@sover.net>
	* converted a couple more variables to BOOL in egoboo.h so they
	would work with code in the ConfigFile code
	* one line in draw_scene_sadreflection() (graphic.c) was causing
	problems (it shouldn't have) so I had to do it the long way
	* Updated the CodeWarrior Pro 5 project with all the new files

2001-01-11 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>
	* Minor clean-up of graphicmad.c and graphicfan.c

	* Fixed character trasnparency by enabling Alpha test

2001-01-11 Germain Sauvé <gersauve@cgocable.ca>
	* Created graphicfan.c, graphicmad.c and graphicprt.c 
	* Ported the water rendering code ( almost )
	* Added glcolor to MAD

2001-01-10 Germain Sauvé <gersauve@cgocable.ca>
	* Remove Begin3DMode form render_fan, render_mad, render_prt and the 
	like. Put Begin3DMode in draw_scene. Replace Begin3DMode by
	glLoadMatrixf(mView.v);
	glMultMatrixf(mWorld.v);
	

2001-01-09 Dan Olson <theoddone@quakefiles.com>
	* Fixed perspective and other rendering bugs using Christian's matrix
	  patch as well as reversing all the glFrontFace calls.  We were
	  previously viewing the back faces of all the polygons, which caused
	  the rendering bugs.
	* Oops, this time I really did break status bars :)  Culling Disabled
	  in Begin2DMode for now.

2000-01-09 Nicholas Vining <mordred@lokigames.com>

	* added atexit(SDL_Quit) to graphic.c in the hope that it'll stop
	locking my mouse cursor when egoboo crashes.
	* Turned off mouse locking. Sucky. At some point we should
	have a key to disable it, but for now hopefully it will inspire
	somebody to add keyboard input.
		* UPDATE: Pulled at Christian LaForte's request, but locking
		  still isn't a long term solution..

2001-01-08 Dan Olson <theoddone@quakefiles.com>
	* Fixed some of the depth buffer things as suggested by Matty Noble
	  on the mailing list.

2001-01-07 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>

	* Updated the scancode list (scancode.txt) for SDL.
	* Temporarily forced networkon to FALSE.
	* Temporarily forced autoturncamera to FALSE.
	* Minor clean-up of game.c and network.c

2001-01-07 Dan Olson <theoddone@quakefiles.com>
	* Partial fix of bad alpha on models

2001-01-07 Benjamin Bishop <bishop@cs.uga.edu>
	* Cleaned up Begin3D
	* fixed newline compile warning on new headers
	* fixed draw_one_bar which fixed character stats
	* fixed draw_map

2001-01-07 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>
	* Additional cleanup of graphic.c
	* Moved enchant functions that were left in graphic.c to enchant.c

2001-01-07 Nicholas Vining <mordred@lokigames.com>
	* Put errorlog.txt in the current directory instead of in basicdat.
	This created a few amusing filenames in the wrong places on my system.

2001-01-07 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>
	* Use the world transformation matrix.
	  The character models now display at the right position
	  (at least in advent.mod).
	* Cleanup of graphic.c (removed duplicated functions, esthetic changes)

2001-01-07 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>
	* Merged in Germain's change to egoboo.dsp and mine.
	* Commented-out some unused variables in graphic.c
	* Attempt to check-in Germain's new setup.txt

2001-01-06 Germain Sauvé <gersauve@cgocable.ca>
	* Implemented the ConfigFile in read_setup
	* Added egoobootypedef.h so you don't need to include
	egoboo.h to have basic type definitions
	* Added egoboostrutil

2001-01-06 Dan Olson <theoddone@quakefiles.com>
	* Partial porting of render_prt()
	* Cleanups to make the code compile under Linux again
	* Now grabs mouse cursor, this makes it nice under X11
	* fixed up a few commented out things and added an SDL_Quit in
	  an error function.

2001-01-06 Dan Olson <theoddone@quakefiles.com>
	* Modified mouse input code to make the movement sane in-game.

2001-01-06 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>
	* Fixed crash when loading MD2 models. It was caused by opening the
	  file without specifying that it was binary.
	* Now call load_all_objects, reset_players and setup_characters
	  for Little-endian (Intel-based) machines. The MD2 file format
	  needs some more massaging for big-endian machines.

2001-01-06 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>
	* Merged Ben's perspective fix with Germain's latest check-in.
	* In main_game(), uncommented the call to update_game.
	* In update_game(), commented out the while condition in
	  the sync loop, so that important functions such as move_characters
	  get called.

2001-01-06 Germain Sauvé <gersauve@cgocable.ca>
	* Put Begin3DMode in draw_scene ( was call in render_fan )

2001-01-06 Benjamin Bishop <bishop@cs.uga.edu>
	* Fixed perspective call in graphic.c
	* Looking at how to rotate the up direction in Begin3D

2001-01-06 Dan Olson <theoddone@quakefiles.com>

	  should also work including render_texmad and draw_map
	* General fixup and some whitespace cleanups in other places
        * Addition of GLVERTEX structure for easier porting of rendering
          functions.

2001-01-06 Christian Laforte <claforte@mailandnews.com>
	* Commented out some unused variables in camera.c, char.c,
	  game.c and graphic.c
	* Changed VC6 project so that it compiles egoboo.exe in the egoboo\
	  directory.

2001-01-04 Dan Olson <theoddone@quakefiles.com>
	* Fixed server takedown on my hardware at program exit. (It wasn't
	  calling SDL_Quit)  If there's a better spot for that let me know.
	* Removal of more various /* PORT */ comment blocks in graphics.c,
	  mostly glEnable's and glDisable's.

2001-01-04 Dan Olson <theoddone@quakefiles.com>
	* Fixed up a small function in graphic.c
	* Removed (apparently) useless -lXv from the link line

2001-01-03 Germain Sauvé <gersauve@cgocable.ca>
	* Added a lot of FILENAME() in functions interacting with files. There
	is probably a lot of redundant calls to FILENAME but it won't hurt.
	* Added #include <math.h> in mathstuff.h

2001-01-03 Nicholas Vining <mordred@lokigames.com>

	* Fixes to the Makefile, mathstuff.c, and a few more things
	to get this to compile again after Morgan's latest wave of changes.

2000-12-16 Morgan Aldridge <classic@sover.net>
	* fixed load_all_menu_images() so it uses the FILENAME()
		macro to load directories - now the MacOS Version
		loads menus correctly

2000-12-14 Morgan Aldridge <classic@sover.net>
	* Moved math stuff from graphics.c, proto.h, egoboo.h
		to mathstuff.c and mathstuff.h.

2000-12-13 Benjamin Bishop <bishop@cs.uga.edu>
        * DONE: render fan is now getting called, looks
          like reasonable data
        * now drawing mesh verts to be displayed
        * TODO: need to get gluLookAt right
        * TODO: why is camera spinning?

2000-12-13 Morgan Aldridge <classic@sover.net>
	* Added a ProjectBuilder project in hopes of eventually
	getting it to compile under Mac OS X.

2000-12-13 Benjamin Bishop <bishop@cs.uga.edu>
	* Finished up _CNV changes
	* TODO: render_fan is not getting called
	  since the camera code is not telling it
	  to draw anything

2000-12-12 Morgan Aldridge <classic@sover.net>
	* Added mac-file.c, still needs work and testing

2000-12-12 Benjamin Bishop <bishop@cs.uga.edu>
	* Fixed up load_mesh and mesh init stuff
        * Ported most of remaining char.c

        * Fixed proto.h so inline becomes __inline for VisualC

2000-12-08 Germain Sauvé <gersauve@cgocable.ca>

	* Added configfile.h and configfile.c
	TODO: include them in egoboo ( change setup.txt )

=======
2000-12-8 Morgan Aldridge <classic@sover.net>
	
	* UPDATE: ported the texture loading stuff in load_one_object()
		to the GLTexture code
	* TODO: finish implementing the alpha value for textures and
		make it work in the code that uses the texture loader

2000-12-7 Nicholas Vining <mordred@lokigames.com>
	
	* Changed definition of TRUE and FALSE. TRUE is (!FALSE), so that
 	  if you have something like this:
	
	  if ((foo & 0x2) == TRUE)

	  it will work.

	* Minor change.log cleanups. Put new entries at the top! :-)

2000-12-6 Benjamin Bishop <bishop@cs.uga.edu>

	* Added GLMATRIX and GLVECTOR types
	* Wrote in equivalent D3D matrix routines
	* Got load_all_objects mostly working
	* Now with heavy diagnostic garbage
