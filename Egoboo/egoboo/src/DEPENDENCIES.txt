= basic dependencies =

The current project requires the following libraries to build

	- SDL
	- SDL_mixer
	- SDL_image
	- SDL_ttf
	- OpenGL
	- enet
	- PhysicsFS >= 2.0.0

An enet source distribution is included with this package, but it is also available as a package on most linux distributions.

You will need to download and use CMake to build the makefiles for PhysicsFS >= 2.0.0. 

There are some additional system-dependent requirements that are listed below.

= experimental Lua integration =

At the present time, there is an experimental integration of Lua into the program. To create the ego_wrapper.c file necessary for the integration, you need to use SWIG in the game directory with the command-line

	swig -lua ego.i

This will automatically generate the file ego_wrapper.c necessary to build the project. This file is *not* being shipped with the source distribution because it is possible that swig will generate different code on different platforms.  You can obtain SWIG for free at http://www.swig.org/

You can ontain Lua from www.liblua.org. Any version above 5.1 should be completely compatible with SWIG.

= Win32 =

There is a gui version of CMake that is very easy to use. You can generate makefiles for most standard compilers/IDEs. You will have to compile the project and add the .lib to your search path.

You should link to the following libraries 

	additional system libraries
	- shlwapi.lib
	- SHFolder.lib
	- Shell32.lib

	SDL libraries
	- SDL_d.lib
	- SDLmain_d.lib

	OpenGL libraries
	- opengl32.lib
	- glu32.lib

	enet libraries
	- enet.lib
	- ws2_32.lib

	PhysicsFS libraries (use the static link library)
	- physfs.lib

	additional SDL libraries
	- SDL_ttf.lib
	- SDL_mixer.lib
	- SDL_image.lib


	for the lua integration, you need the lua 5.0 or better libraries. These should be the static link libraries.
	- lua5.1.lib
	- lualib5.1.lib

Most of these libraries require dll files to be in your system path, most likely in the game directory. The exception are the OpenGL and system libraries which are located in special folders under the windows directory. Because of other dependencies of the SDL libraries, you will need some version of the following libraries

	libpng.dll
	libtiff.dll
	zlib.dll

If the system did not find a library or expects a different filename, it will alert you.


= Linux =

You will have to build and install the PhysicsFS library manually, as PhysicsFS >= 2.0.0 is not available on Ubuntu (and maybe other distros). Once you install CMake using your package manager, you can execute cmake from the console in the PhysicsFS directory. To obtain the source files for PhysicsFS, go to  http://icculus.org/physfs/. To actually build the project use “cmake : make all : make install”

You should link to the following libraries

	SDL libraries
	- libSDL
	- libSDLmain

	OpenGL libraries
	- libGL
	- libGLU

	enet libraries
	- libenet

	additional SDL libraries
	- libSDL_ttf
	- libSDL_mixer
	- libSDL_image

	PhysicsFS libraries (use the static link library)
	- libphysfs

	for the lua integration, you need the Lua 5.0 libraries
	- liblua50
	- liblualib50

Obtain the libraries from your package manager. It may be necessary to get the dev versions of the package, and possibly to build and install them to be able to build egoboo from sources.

Instructions for making and installing the program can be found elsewhere.


= Mac =

Should be remarkably similar to Linux
