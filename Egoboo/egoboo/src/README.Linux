Egoboo is set up to use the Linux make command to build and install Egoboo. Simply type

    make all
    sudo make install

and the game will be built and installed. This method works essentially the same as downloading and installing the files using a package manager, and similarly requires super-user password.

If you do not have a sudo password, you can install Egoboo to a local directory by defining a PREFIX environmental variable on the command-line. A common usage would be

    make all PREFIX=$HOME/.local
    make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local

which will build and install the game into your own home folder. To start the game, execute the shell script called egoboo-2.x in the home folder.


The program requires certain packages and other settings to build. A comprehensive list can be found in the DEPENDENCIES file.

If you experience problems, please ask in the Egoboo Forums at http://egoboo.sourceforge.net/forum/. Thank you.
