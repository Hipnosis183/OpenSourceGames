What I've done already:

== 1. Model and skin ==
I did these a while ago, so I don't remember whether I tested it in game, but I don't think
I did. The model might need size adjustments...

== 2. Messages ==
I might come up with more of these later, but right now there are 107 (unless I counted
wrong, but it's something close to that). Most of them are actually in multiple lines...
I'm not sure what the game does to messages that are too long right now, but if it knows
how to deal with them, it would be a lot more convenient to have them all in one line.
I think there might be one or two that actually need to be broken up, though (because it's
kind of a part of the humor). So maybe it's best to just leave them as they are... though
that would be very tedious to script for.
...Just don't mess with the wording; I spent a while getting them all "just right". =P

== 3. Data file ==
I don't think you have to change anything there... it should all be set up right.



What still needs to be done:

== 1. Script ==
When you eat it, it should recover health (1/5th - 1/3rd of what a life potion does) and
give you back some of your maximum life (about a half a point; this could be randomized
a bit, too). It shows the third message, and then the fifth (I think it already does this).
Then it should show the seventh. If the character is illiterate, it then shows the tenth
message and does not give you a fortune. If the cookie has been dropped in water, it shows
the eighth message and does not give you a fortune. If the cookie has come in contact with
fire, it shows the ninth message and does not give you a fortune.
If the eater can read and the message hasn't been damaged, it shows message 11 and gives
you a random fortune.

== 2. Dark Ones ==
If you feed them a cookie, they should give you something nice.

== 3. Message system ==
I think the message system should be altered so that the time the messages stay on the
screen is longer by default and can be altered in the setup file. Maybe the maximum number
of messages should also be greater by default...
The cookies give a lot of messages before they even get to the fortune, and some of the
fortunes are pretty long... Good excuse to upgrade the message system? =P

== 4. Icon ==
I didn't do one.
