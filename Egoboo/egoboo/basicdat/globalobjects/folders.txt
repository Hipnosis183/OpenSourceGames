The globalobjects directory is broken up into subdirectories by the in-game purpose of the objects

armor       = shields and suits of armor
magic       = spell books, spell orbs, runes, etc.
potions     = anything that comes in a bottle
scrolls     = magical scrolls, usually one time use like potions
weapons     = anything hat does direct damage, throws a missile, or blocks damage
magic_items = any remaining objects that can be picked up and are essentially magical in nature (rings, bracelets, shoes ...)
items       = anything that can be picked up that does not go in the above categories

traps       = devious and deadly traps for the treasure hungry adventurer
misc        = objects that are neither items or monsters, usually props such as chairs, pillars and tables
monsters    = enough said
players     = all models that could be potentially played by a player
pets        = mounts and pets the players or monsters can carry or ride

unique      = things that there are only 1 of in the whole world (or just a few)
works_in_progess = not ready for use yet, but may need to be tried in-game

----------------------------

other ideas for directories

reagents    = items that are used up to make something else. technically, things like an ammo box might belong here, but it is really for the idea of alchemy
