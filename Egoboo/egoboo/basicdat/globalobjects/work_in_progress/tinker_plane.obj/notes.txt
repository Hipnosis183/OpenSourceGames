This is an esxperimental test plane from the from the Royal Bishopian Air Force. It is being built by G'Nomes, so it is very dangerous!

It should be able to pick up objects into its bomb bay and then drop themusing the rider's normal grab right.

Using the rider's grab left will cause the player to be ejected from the cockpit.

It is using the bullets from the Gatlin Gonne at the moment.
