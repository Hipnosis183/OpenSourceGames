//'Chaos', made by Clonkinator. It basically just is a whip that does slightly more (CRUSH)
//damage than a normal whip, glows and shrinks the target every time it hits. Doesn't work
//against enemies that are resistant to poison. No drawbacks for the user.
//Oh, and by the way, this weapon can even hit several enemies at the same time. Cool, eh?
