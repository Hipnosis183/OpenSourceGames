Overview
--------
     Egoboo uses .MD2 files for object models.
These can be created with the Quake2 Modeller,
which is a freeware program I included with
this game.  I didn't write the modeller, but
it's by far the best I've found.
     Your models can't have more than 128
vertices, and some vertices need to be used
for grips.  What are grips?
     Grips are where weapons get attached to
your character.  Each character can have up
to 2 grips ( Left and Right ), each of which
takes 4 vertices.  THE GRIP VERTICES SHOULD BE
PUT INTO THE MODEL LAST.  Just cut and paste
from some other model and you'll be fine.
     SPAWNLAST is used by weapons, and this is
just a single extra vertex that floats at the
tip of the weapon.  Attack particles get spawned
at this point.  THE SPAWNLAST VERTEX SHOULD BE
PUT INTO THE MODEL LAST.
     A couple quick notes about the Quake2
Modeller...  First, it crashes often, so save,
make back ups, and live with it.  Second, it uses
the Quake2 Palette and .PCX files for skins.  Draw
your skins as .BMP files using the Egoboo palette,
then do an image conversion.  Several free programs
are out there that can do it.



Frame Names
-----------
     The most important thing about creating a new
model is to name your frames correctly.  The name
consists of a 2 letter action type, followed by a
the 2 digit frame number, followed by any special
codes.  It looks something like KA03SP.  Not too
tough.
