Overview
--------
     The data files for Egoboo started out simple.  Then
they got complex, and I updated them.  More complexity,
and more updates, until I had so many files that updating
them all individually took too long.  That's why there
are Expansions.
     Expansions are those cryptic four letter IDSZ things
at the bottom of certain data files.  This document lists
the different expansions and says a little bit about each
one.



Particle Expansions
-------------------
     Particle expansions go in PART?.TXT files, and
are followed by a single number.  Be sure to precede
each with a colon, or it won't be read.
:[TURN] 0	// This isn't very useful...  Don't turn with character
:[ARMO] 0	// Particle is armor piercing ( Base defense of 0 ) 
:[BLOC] 0	// Particle can't be blocked by a shield
:[ARRO] 0	// Particle only damages the character to whom it is attached
:[TIME] 0	// Don't set invincibility time on hit

Character Expansions
--------------------
     Character expansions go in DATA.TXT files, and
are followed by a single number.  Be sure to precede
each with a colon, or it won't be read.

Enchant Expansions
------------------
     Enchant expansions go in ENCHANT.TXT files, and
are followed by a single number.  Be sure to precede
each with a colon, or it won't be read.
:[STAY] 1	// Stay around even after the owner has died
:[AMOU] 8       // 0 to 15, Amount to spawn each time
:[TIME] 25      // 1 to 100, Time until next spawn
:[TYPE] 0       // 0 to 7, Type of particles to spawn

:[OVER] 1       // 1 to 100, Create a child overlay object with this state
                // The overlay follows the target around, and is killed when
                // the enchantment ends...


Module Expansions
-----------------
     These go in the MENU.TXT files.  These
aren't entered by hand, rather a character in
the module must use the AddIDSZ function to
automagically append it to the file.
     Any given module may check another module
to see if it has a given IDSZ, for hiding
certain modules until a secret is found or
the other module is beaten.
