So the idea is instead of static predefined treasure in Egoboo, we implement a random treasure reward system.
You never know beforehand what you get out of a chest or from that big boss. I was thinking of having different
treasure levels (TL) depending on that determines a reward category and the game picks a random object from that
list of valid rewards. Maybe we could have special TL for only G'nomish items or a random Kursed item?

A chest or boss could hold multiple random items that is defined in spawn.txt like:
  : RANDOMTL1OBJECT   0   0   0   I   0   0   0   0   0   F   F
  : RANDOMTL1OBJECT   0   0   0   I   0   0   0   0   0   F   F
  : RANDOMTL2OBJECT   0   0   0   I   0   0   0   0   0   F   F
which would spawn 2 random normal objects and 1 magic object (for example 1 torch, quiver and Book of Fireball)
